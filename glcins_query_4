#insulin data extraction
#✅ Pull insulin administrations for patients in your cohort_1.
#✅ Only pick administrations where amount > 0 (meaning actually given).
#✅ Label each row: how much insulin was given, at what time, etc.
#✅ Include subject_id, hadm_id, stay_id, starttime, amount, rate, itemid.
#In MIMIC-IV:
#IV insulin drips and boluses are logged in mimic_icu.inputevents.
#Relevant insulin itemids include:
#223257 – Insulin Regular (drip/bolus)
#223258 – Insulin Aspart (Novolog)
#223259 – Insulin Glargine (Lantus)
#223260 – Insulin Lispro (Humalog)
#223261 – Insulin Detemir (Levemir)
#(But usually, for infusions, the main one is 223257, Insulin Regular.)
#We'll focus primarily on IV insulin administration.
